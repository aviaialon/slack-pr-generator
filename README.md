# Slackyify Github Pull Requests

So, you have a PR that you want to get into production. After a long arduous code review your code is
approved and about to go live. Now you need to warn your team on Slack. You go to your proper channel
and craft a beautiful message about the code that is about to go live and even link the URL to your pull
request so the team can see it. What a wonderful person you are. But why the hell did you even have to
even do that! The PR page itself had the link and the description in the title! Well, this extension is
here to help.

With one click from the pull request page you will be alerted with a well crafted message that is ready
to be copied and pasted right into Slack.
